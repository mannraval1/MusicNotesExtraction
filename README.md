# 🎵 Music Notes Extraction & Recognition

A Digital Signal Processing (DSP) project that identifies musical notes from audio signals. Using frequency analysis and signal processing techniques, this project can process a music file (like Beethoven's *Für Elise*), detect the fundamental frequencies, and map them to their corresponding musical notes.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Frequency Detection:** Analyzes audio signals to find dominant frequency components.
- **Note Mapping:** Converts detected frequencies into standard musical notes (A, B, C, etc.).
- **Signal Visualization:** Includes tools to plot waveforms and spectral data for better analysis.
- **Audio Reconstruction:** Capable of generating a recreated version of the analyzed audio based on detected notes.

## 🛠️ Project Structure

- `MusicNoteRecognition.mlx`: The main MATLAB Live Script containing the core logic and analysis.
- `FreqToNote.m`: A helper function to map frequency values (Hz) to musical notes.
- `plotsound.m`: Script for visualizing the audio signal in the time and frequency domains.
- `FurElise_Slow.mp3`: Input reference audio used for testing.
- `fur_elise_recreated.wav`: The output audio generated by the extraction algorithm.

## 📈 Methodology

1. **Signal Loading:** Read the digital audio file into MATLAB.
2. **Windowing:** Divide the signal into segments to analyze notes over time.
3. **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT):** Transition from the time domain to the frequency domain to identify the pitch.
4. **Note Identification:** Compare detected peaks against standard note frequencies.
5. **Output Generation:** Log the sequence of notes and reconstruct the melody.
